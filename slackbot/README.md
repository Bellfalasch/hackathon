# SlackBot Hackathon

This hackathon is all about creating cool bot's for [Slack](https://slack.com).
We are going to use [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) for this since we have not
yet a fully working bot-framework for Enonic XP.

Requirements:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed.
* [Enonic Slack](https://enonic.slack.com) account.
* Assigned a bot token (ask me for one).
* Current clone of this repository.
